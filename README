Facebook Invite Uninvited

This is an extension which adds "Select uninvited" button
to the "Invite Friends" or "Invite Members" dialog
which appears when you are inviting people to the event.

Usually if the event is public, people are allowed
to invite their friends to the event,
so people can be invited several times.

"Select uninvited" button allows you to invite
only those of your friends who haven't been invited yet,
so you don't bug them too much.

Don't forget to scroll the list of your friends to the bottom
otherwise some of them will not be selected (this is a known bug,
we'll fix it in the future).
