Facebook Invite Uninvited

This is an extension which allows convenient Selection of your friends
while inviting them to a Facebook event. Currently implemented
features are: "Select Uninvited", "Clear selection".

Usually if the event is public, people are allowed to invite
their friends to the event, so people can be invited several times.
"Select uninvited" button allows you to invite
only those of your friends who haven't been invited yet,
so you don't bug them too much.

When no people are invited to the event "Select uninvited"
button behaves as "Select all" - selects all of your friends.
