Invite uninvited friends to a Facebook event.

This extension adds "Select All", "Select Uninvited", "Clear selection" buttons
on the "Invite Friends" Facebook dialog screen when inviting your friends
to the Facebook event.

These buttons allow convenient manipulation of your friends list
when inviting them to the Facebook event.

Special feature of this extension is "Select Uninvited" button.

Usually if the event is public, people are allowed to invite their friends
to the event, so some people can be invited several times which might piss them off.
"Select uninvited" button allows you to invite only those of your friends
who haven't been invited yet, so you don't bug them too much.
